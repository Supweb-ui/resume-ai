          Hi 👋, I’m Omkar Pawar — a passionate Web Developer who loves building full-stack
          web apps using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. ResumeAI helps students create
          professional resumes effortlessly using AI.
          <br /><br />
          I built ResumeAI to simplify resume creation for students and job seekers.
          It uses AI to generate tailored resumes based on your input, making the process quick and easy.
          <br /><br />
          I am constantly improving ResumeAI and adding new features.
          It is an open-source project, and you can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/omkarpawar/resume-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
          <br /><br />
